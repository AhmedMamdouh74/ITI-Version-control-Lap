## 1. Annotated Tags vs. Lightweight Tags
- **Annotated Tags:**
  - Stored as full objects in Git.
  - Include metadata such as the taggerâ€™s name, email, and a tagging message.
- **Lightweight Tags:**
  - Simply pointers to specific commits without any extra metadata.

*Use annotated tags for releases and lightweight tags for simpler cases.*

## 2. When to Use Rebase
- **Benefits:**
  - Maintains a clean, linear commit history.
  - Applies changes from one branch onto another efficiently.
- **Caution:**
  - Avoid using rebase on public/shared branches as it rewrites commit history.
